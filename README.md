# Pet-Cuddle-O-Tron
"Pet Cuddle-O-Tron" allows users to receive email reminders about events related to their pets using AWS services

Summary of AWS Services Used in the "Pet Cuddle-O-Tron" Project for Email Delivery:

1. Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
Purpose: Send transactional emails (e.g., reminders) securely and at scale.

Utility:

Sandbox Mode: Ensures emails are sent only to verified addresses (prevents spam).

High Deliverability: Guarantees emails reach inboxes instead of spam folders.

Verified Identities: Validates sender ("Sending Address") and recipient ("Customer Address") emails.

2. AWS Lambda
Purpose: Execute serverless code to handle email workflows.

Utility:

email_reminder_lambda: Generates and sends emails via SES when triggered by AWS Step Functions.

api_lambda: Processes API requests and triggers the state machine workflow.

Cost-Effective: Pay only for compute time used during execution.

3. AWS Step Functions
Purpose: Orchestrate serverless workflows.

Utility:

State Machine: Coordinates timed delays (e.g., reminders) and triggers the email Lambda function.

Error Handling: Manages retries and failures in the workflow.

4. Amazon API Gateway
Purpose: Expose APIs to interact with the backend.

Utility:

REST API: Routes frontend requests to the api_lambda function.

CORS Support: Enables secure communication between the S3-hosted frontend and backend.

5. Amazon S3
Purpose: Host the static frontend application.

Utility:

Static Website Hosting: Stores HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Public Access: Configured to serve the website globally.

6. IAM Roles
Purpose: Grant secure permissions to AWS resources.

Utility:

Lambda Execution Role: Allows Lambda to access SES, SNS, and CloudWatch Logs.

State Machine Role: Permits Step Functions to invoke Lambda and interact with SNS.

7. AWS CloudFormation
Purpose: Automate infrastructure setup.

Utility:

Templates: Deploys IAM roles and policies quickly, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

Key Workflow for Email Delivery:
Frontend (S3) â†’ User submits a request via the web app.

API Gateway â†’ Routes the request to api_lambda.

Step Functions â†’ Triggers a timer and executes email_reminder_lambda.

Lambda + SES â†’ Generates and sends the email to the verified recipient.

Why This Architecture is Powerful:

Fully Serverless: No servers to manage; scales automatically.

Cost-Effective: Pay-per-use pricing for Lambda, SES, and Step Functions.

Secure: IAM roles enforce least privilege, and SES sandbox prevents abuse.

End-to-End Automation: From user input to email delivery, everything is event-driven.

This setup showcases AWSâ€™s serverless ecosystem for building scalable, secure, and cost-efficient email solutions! ðŸš€
